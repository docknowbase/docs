To configure and tweak PostgreSQL database settings for performance and tuning, you need to adjust various parameters in the PostgreSQL configuration file, typically named `postgresql.conf`. Here are the key steps and considerations:

1. **Location of the Configuration File**:
   - The `postgresql.conf` file is usually located in the `PGDATA` directory, which is the data directory of your PostgreSQL installation[4][7].

2. **Key Parameters to Adjust**:
   - **`max_connections`**: Controls the maximum number of concurrent connections to the database. It should be set to a reasonably low number to avoid resource exhaustion. A good starting point is 4-8 times the number of CPUs[6][8].
   - **`shared_buffers`**: Determines the amount of memory used for caching database pages. It should be set to 20-40% of the system's RAM[6][8].
   - **`work_mem`**: Specifies the maximum amount of memory each query can use before falling back to temporary disk files. It should be set to 1-5% of the system's RAM[6][8].
   - **`maintenance_work_mem`**: Limits the maximum amount of memory used by maintenance operations like `CREATE INDEX` or `ALTER TABLE`[6].
   - **`effective_cache_size`**: Estimates the amount of system memory available for caching data. It should be set to a value that reflects the actual memory available for disk caching[2][4].

3. **Additional Considerations**:
   - **Indexing**: Proper indexing is crucial for query performance. Use the `EXPLAIN` command to analyze queries and identify areas for optimization[2][6].
   - **Partitioning**: Partitioning large tables can improve query performance by allowing PostgreSQL to quickly access relevant data[2][6].
   - **Connection Pooling**: Using a connection pooler like PgBouncer can help manage connections efficiently and reduce overhead[2][6].

4. **Tools for Monitoring and Tuning**:
   - **`pg_stat_activity` and `pg_stat_database` views**: These can be used to monitor database activity and identify performance issues[2][6].
   - **Third-party tools**: Tools like dbForge Studio for PostgreSQL, postgresqltuner.pl, PgBadger, and pgMustard can help analyze configuration and provide tuning recommendations[7].

### Example Configuration Snippets

- **`postgresql.conf`**:
  ```sql
  max_connections = 32
  shared_buffers = 8GB
  work_mem = 128MB
  maintenance_work_mem = 256MB
  effective_cache_size = 16GB
  ```

- **Using SQL to Check Current Settings**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name AS setting_name, setting AS setting_value, unit AS setting_unit
  FROM pg_settings
  WHERE name IN ('max_connections', 'shared_buffers', 'work_mem', 'maintenance_work_mem', 'effective_cache_size');
  ```

By carefully adjusting these parameters and using the right tools for monitoring and tuning, you can significantly improve the performance of your PostgreSQL database.

### Disabling Autocommit in PostgreSQL

To disable autocommit in PostgreSQL, you need to use a client-side command since PostgreSQL operates in autocommit mode by default and this behavior cannot be changed on the server side. Here are the steps to disable autocommit using `psql`:

1. **Open `psql`**:
   Start a `psql` session.

2. **Disable Autocommit**:
   Use the following command to disable autocommit for the current session:
   ```sql
   \set AUTOCOMMIT off
   ```

3. **Verify Autocommit Status**:
   You can check the autocommit status using:
   ```sql
   \echo :AUTOCOMMIT
   ```

**Note**: Disabling autocommit can lead to issues such as long-running transactions holding locks and preventing autovacuum from removing dead tuples, which can cause table bloat[7][6].

### Best Practices for Connection Pooling in PostgreSQL

1. **Use a Connection Pooler**:
   Tools like PgBouncer or pgpool-II can manage connections efficiently, reducing overhead and improving performance[3][10][11].

2. **Configure Pool Size**:
   Set the pool size based on your application's needs. A larger pool can handle more concurrent connections but may consume more resources[3][10].

3. **Monitor Pool Performance**:
   Regularly check metrics such as connection utilization rate, wait times, and acquisition times to ensure optimal performance[3][10].

### Optimizing Query Performance Using Indexing in PostgreSQL

1. **Create Appropriate Indexes**:
   Use indexes on columns frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY` clauses to speed up query execution[4][13].

2. **Use Partial Indexes**:
   Create partial indexes for specific conditions to reduce indexing overhead[4].

3. **Monitor Index Usage**:
   Use `pg_stat_user_indexes` to identify unused indexes and remove them to improve write performance[12][13].

### Key Configuration Parameters to Tune for PostgreSQL Performance

1. **`shared_buffers`**:
   Set to 25% of system RAM to improve caching efficiency[15].

2. **`effective_cache_size`**:
   Estimate the amount of system memory available for caching data[15].

3. **`work_mem`**:
   Adjust to balance query performance and memory usage[15].

4. **`max_connections`**:
   Set to a reasonable value to prevent resource exhaustion[15].

### Monitoring Performance Metrics in PostgreSQL

1. **Use Built-in Views**:
   Utilize views like `pg_stat_activity` and `pg_stat_database` to monitor active connections and database performance[1][5].

2. **Track Key Metrics**:
   Monitor CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and query performance metrics[5][8].

3. **Regularly Review Logs**:
