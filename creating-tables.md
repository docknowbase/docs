### Creating a Table with Foreign Key Constraints in PostgreSQL

To create a table with foreign key constraints in PostgreSQL, you can use the `CREATE TABLE` statement with the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE department(
  dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  dept_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE employee(
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  hiredate DATE,
  manager_id INT,
  salary INT,
  dept_id INT,
  CONSTRAINT FK_employee_department FOREIGN KEY(dept_id) REFERENCES department(dept_id)
);
```

In this example, the `dept_id` column in the `employee` table is defined as a foreign key that references the primary key `dept_id` in the `department` table[1][7].

### Best Practices for Naming Columns in PostgreSQL Tables

Here are some best practices for naming columns in PostgreSQL tables:

- **Use lowercase letters**: PostgreSQL automatically converts unquoted identifiers to lowercase.
- **Separate words with underscores**: Instead of using camelCase or PascalCase, use underscores to separate words in column names.
- **Be descriptive**: Use descriptive names for columns to improve readability.
- **Avoid abbreviations**: Avoid using abbreviations that may be unclear to others.
- **Use consistent naming conventions**: Establish a consistent naming convention throughout your database[2].

### Using the LIKE Option When Creating Tables in PostgreSQL

The `LIKE` option allows you to create a new table based on the definition of another table, including column attributes and indexes. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table (LIKE old_table INCLUDING ALL);
```

This statement creates a new table named `new_table` with the same structure as `old_table`, including all indexes and constraints[5].

### Differences Between Using SERIAL and GENERATED AS IDENTITY for Primary Keys

- **SERIAL**: `SERIAL` is a not-so-standard but convenient way to create sequential columns. It is equivalent to creating a sequence and setting the default value of the column to the next value of the sequence.
- **GENERATED AS IDENTITY**: This is the SQL standards-compliant way to create identity columns. It provides more flexibility and control over the sequence generation.

Here's an example of using `SERIAL`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  last_login TIMESTAMP
);
```

And here's an example of using `GENERATED AS IDENTITY`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  user_id INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  last_login TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Creating a Temporary Table in PostgreSQL

To create a temporary table in PostgreSQL, you can use the `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE` statement. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE myTempTable(
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

Temporary tables exist only for the duration of the database session and are automatically dropped when the session is closed. You can use the `TEMP` keyword interchangeably with `TEMPORARY`[3][4].
